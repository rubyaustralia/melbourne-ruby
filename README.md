# Melbourne Ruby

* Hack Night: [James McLaren](https://twitter.com/jamesmclaren555), [Tom Dalling](https://twitter.com/tom_dalling)

## Venues

* Zendesk, 67 Queen St, Melbourne 3000 (RORO)
* Envato, 121 King St, Melbourne 3000 (Hack Night)

## Food Options

RORO has grown to the point where only pizza makes any financial sense. At the moment we are up to ~57 pizzas (for 120-140 people) at a cost of around $1k. For Hack Night and InstallFest, it's up to the organiser and depends on the anticipated attendance.

Options for other meetups:

* Crust Pizzas - approx one pizza for every two people, ~$10 per person, gluten free options available. 9429 3949, from ordering, delivery is usually around an hour's wait.
* ASRC Catering - $17 per person for six finger food items. Requires ordering close to a month in advance, though final numbers can be confirmed about a week before the event. All vegetarian, and many gluten/lactose-free options.
* Miss Chu - roughly $14 per person (currently paying just under $1400 for ~100 people), though could certainly order more and it would be eaten. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, all lactose free, and most gluten free.

## Drinks Options

### Alcoholic

RORO now has a drinks sponsor, Marketplacer. We order the drinks on their behalf (to be delivered the prior afternoon so that they can be refrigerated - they're delivered warm), then forward them the invoice for payment. Vendor is [The Wigs Cellar](http://www.thewigscellar.com.au/old/), on Queen St (03 9670 2753). At present the drinks order is:

* 5 cases of beer
* 1 case of apple cider
* Half a case of pear cider
* 2 bottles sauvignon blanc
* 1 bottle pinot grigio
* 2 bottles shiraz
* 1 bottle pinot noir

This runs about $570.

For other meetups:

* Order from Dan Murphy's online the day before (more options, slightly cheaper, delivery cost per case).
* Order from LiquorRun.com on the day (less options, single delivery cost, local business)

### Non-Alcoholic

For RORO, Zendesk graciously provides non-alcoholic drinks (though lately they seem to be scaling this back, so we may need to add non-alcoholic drinks to our Wigs order). For other meetups, they can be ordered from the same vendor as the alcohol, or purchased separately.

## Sponsors

All events are covered by Ruby Australia via annual sponsorship, aside from the venue (and in the case of RORO, drinks). At each event we should be thanking the [current Ruby and Emerald level sponsors of Ruby Australia](https://ruby.org.au/sponsorship), plus the venue and drinks sponsors.

* Zendesk (RORO venue sponsor)
* Marketplacer (RORO drinks sponsor)

## Code of Conduct

All events are run under the [Ruby Australia Code of Conduct](https://ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct) and its associated [reporting](https://ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct-reporting) and [enforcement](https://ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct-enforcement) guidelines. As an event organiser you have responsibilities under this CoC, so please ensure you've read it and understand it.
